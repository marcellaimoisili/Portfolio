          ABSTRACT
        </h4>


        <p>
          As a Summer 2017 Graphic & Production Design Intern at SilverbirdTV, I collaborated with members of the Condex Design division for two weeks
          to create the title sequence for a Silverbird segment called "Ultimate Countdown."
          The segment aired for 5 weeks over the Summer, reaching an audience of over 5,000 viewers.
        </p>

          01 –– PROCESS
        </h4>

        <p>
          To begin formulating a design we first studied the nature of the segment and its topics/contents to compile a creative brief.
          The segment was to be a simple daily countdown of trending topics in society for Nigerian youths.
          The primary audience were kids ages 10 -16. Keeping this in mind, we held a meeting with the segment creators and consolidated our
          ideas into a creative pitch. Once we received approval from the client, we began ideating
          potential concepts to suitably illustrate and introduce the segment.

          02 –– STORYBOARDING
        </h4>

        <p>
          We began by sketching some rough visuals of key frames that summarized the flow of different concepts for the title sequence.
          Once we decided on a concept, we created style frames in Photoshop and After Effects
          to give the client a better idea of the actual look and feel that the final product would have.

        <h4>
          04 –– PRODUCTION
        </h4>

        <p>
          After additional meetings with the client to finalize plans and receive their approval,
          we began creating assets through illustration, modeling, and animation.
          The workload was divided so that I did most of the illustration while my partner focused primarily on modeling (we both worked on animations).
          We worked closely to maintain style guidelines to encourage consistency throughout the project.
          Because my partner had more experience working with After Effects, I took the opportunity to soak in as much as I could and heed his advice/criticism.
          As I worked on the project, I got to practice:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Stylizing with textures, lighting, shapes and shadows.</li>
          <li>Using 3D cameras to build camera rigs in Adobe After Effects.</li>
          <li>Using key frames to time and dictate motion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Addition: I got the chance to also create the audio/instrumental and sound effects for the project. (Garage Band)</em>
        </p>

        <h4>
          05 –– FINAL
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Rough cut:</strong>
          We assembled all the assets of the title sequence and used Premiere Pro to sync our animations with
          title cards and sound effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fine cut:</strong>
          We made minor changes to the file and tightened animations.
          We also made sure to replace few placeholder assets with final assets at full resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Final deliverable:</strong>
          The final deliverable for our client was a QuickTime file. The isolated title sequence
         can be viewed below!
