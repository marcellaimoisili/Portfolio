        <p> Hi, I'm Marcella!</p>
        <p>I am currently a second semester Sophomore at Cornell University studying Information Science (UI/UX design) and Computer Science.
        During my junior year of highschool, I was given the opportunity to intern at a leading TV station in Nigeria and ever since then I've been obsessed with digital media production and design processes.
        I am equally fascinated by the components that drive and allow for functional applications and am working towards achieving my dream of becoming a full stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>A multidisciplinary designer in the making, my design practice varies from UX to 3D illustration and motion graphics.
          In addition, I am extremely passionate about design in the context of emerging technologies and constantly work to improve and expand my technical skills.
          Recently, I've been working on improving my understanding of vanilla JS and frameworks such as Angular. I have also been spending time creating content and messing around with
          digital design and visual effects applications such as Sketch, Photoshop, and After Effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I am interested in understanding the impact and social implications of designed solutions as well as the
          role technology plays in shaping and enhancing the future. In particular, I'm curious about the legal framework in which contemporary technology operates and
          its various challenges––from privacy in big data and social computing to intellectual property, security, freedom of information, and the nature of innovation and collaboration.
          It is this curiosity that has compelled me to seriously consider pursuing a degree in law to investigate the legal, ethical, and policy foundations of information technology.

         </p>
        <p>
          Outside the world of technology, I enjoy listening to and making music, playing the trombone, dancing, watching movies, and making art.
          I'm currently looking for new and exciting internship opportunities where I can express my creativity and develop my craft! </p>
