            ABSTRACT
          </h4>


          <p>
            Our client is "Anything Goes," the only musical troupe on Cornell's campus.
            The group consists of members from all class years who are dedicated to keeping the enthusiasm of musical theatre alive.
            The club wants an informative website to keep their audience updated about their shows throughout
            the semester. The group also seeks an interactive website which will allow
            them to connect with students who are interested in joining or auditioning as well
            as anyone interested in attending their shows.
          </p>

        <p>
        The profile of the site's potential users ranges from students who may be interested in
        joining the troupe, to friends and family interested in attending one of their productions.
        After hosting interviews with potential users, we were able to pinpoint common needs held by
        the audience. The majority of potential users:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>Want to learn more about the troupe.</li>
          <li>Want to purchase tickets.</li>
          <li>Are interested in joining the listserve.</li>
          <li>Need a website with easy Navigation.</li>
          <li>Need a website that is simple and not overbearing with irrelevant text or content.</li>
          <li>Need to be able to find information easily.</li>
          <li>Need to be able to contact the group.</li>

        <h4>
          04 –– FIRST ITERATION
        </h4>


        <p>
          We developed the structure of our website in accordance with feedback comments from meetings with clients and potential users.
          Additionally, in examining existing platforms, we noticed that many of the professionally made sites had landing pages.
          For this reason, we decided to include one in the making of our website.
        </p>

          <p>
            For our third iteration, we decided to stay true to our original idea
            of maintaining a monochromatic color scheme across the site and allowing users to hover
            above banner images to reveal the semester's production theme colors. This design choice
            makes it possible to maintain a cohesive site and simultaneously reflect unique themes.

          <h4>
            07 –– USER TESTING
          </h4>


          <p>
            We conducted our user tests by selecting participants that belong to our client's target audience.
            We gave them a series of tasks to complete (fully testing the flow and navigation of the entire site),
            recorded and took notes on their results/performances, and gathered feedback to determined what
            re-design choices we would have to make. From these tests, we decided to simplify certain features on our website.
            For instance, we had initially included a hidden 'Tickets' form on every page which
            responded as a pop up to user's hovering above any 'Ticket' button or image. However, users found this
            a bit "annoying." For simplicity, we decided to just create a separate tab for ticketing where the user could navigate to and fill out
            the form if they desired to do so. This kept the site's content more organized and eliminated
            the redundancy of our previous solution.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="detail">

        <h4>
          08 –– FINAL
        </h4>


        <p>
          There were some other features that did not make it onto the final website.
          In addition to the changes already previously stated, we had also discussed having each individual
          image in the Gallery's slideshow contain blurbs
          that would appear when users hovered above any given image. Because I solely worked
          on the gallery page, I ran into some technical difficulties while trying to implement these features.
          The main problem was that it was difficult to sync the exact moment the image stopped
          sliding automatically with the moment in which the hover text appeared with
          information about that specific image. I first tried to break this problem
          up and come up with some solutions. I tried writing script in JavaScript that would pause the
          slideshow when a user hovered above an image. I then
          used CSS to create an opaque block element with text inside that appears while the
          slideshow is paused. However, it became increasingly difficult to keep track of this when
          the previous button was hit. In addition, a lot of the formatting was not showing up as
          planned (across browsers and devices) and at the time I just did not have the time or knowledge of JavaScript
          needed to perfect the gallery idea before the submission deadline and therefore
          decided to settle for a little less. The gallery is fully functional with an automated
          looping of the images (on screens too small to use control buttons).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, in discussing deployment options with the client, we suggested using cloud platforms
          such as Heroku to host the website (should they find the cost of purchasing a domain and managing the site
          an inconvenience.) As taught in this course, it is important that we ensure the client has some knowledge
          of the process of deployment and give them the opportunity to make choices that are most convenient for them.

          What's Next?
        </h4>

        <p>
          By the end of this Spring semester, I will have increased my knowledge of UX / UI and Product Design
          concepts by taking CS1998-603, a course run by Cornell's App Dev
          training program. I will learn how to follow the intensive workflow of an entire design process while
          coming up with thoughtful solutions for existing applications using prototyping tools, and other applications
          such as Sketch and Origami Studio.
          </p>
          <p>
          I will also be taking INFO 2300, Intermediate Design and Programming for
          the Web, CS 2110 Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, and CS 1380 Data Science. Having taken these courses,
          I will be able to design and implement nontrivial Java programs, understand GUIs (as expressed in Java),
          analyze programs to determine their running times, and understand basic data structures.
        </p>
